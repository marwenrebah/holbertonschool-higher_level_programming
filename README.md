# Welcome to the Python World 🐍

You've entered the exciting world of Python!

As you explore the Python language (and most higher-level languages), you'll discover that there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same task. Some tasks may have one standard implementation, while others offer a variety of approaches.

Python comes with a linter and style guide called PEP8, which is now known as PyCode. At Holberton, we won't initially use PyCode, as it enforces stricter guidelines compared to PEP8. If you encounter warnings while running PEP8, don't fret; you can safely ignore them.

Enjoy your Python journey!
